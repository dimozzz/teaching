\section{List of open problems (approximate)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item (*)~--- interesting for me;
    \item (**)~--- imply something that interesting for community.
    \item (***)~--- imply solution of long-standing open problem.
\end{itemize}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item (**) Lower bounds for $\EQ$ dag protocols.
    \item (*) Separation between boolean dag and $\EQ$ dag protocols.
    \item (*) Lower bound for NOF boolean dag protocols.
    \item (***) Lower bound for NOF real dag protocols. ``Validity'' condition: $A(x, y) + B(y, z) +
        C(x, z) \ge 0$. Imply lower bounds on $Th(2)$ (and $LS_2$) proof system.
    \item (*) Definition of models that can capture $LS_2$ but weaker than NOF dag protocols.
    \item (***) Lower bounds on randomized dag protocols.
    \item (*) Lower bounds on randomized decision dag model. (***) And lifting theorems. 
    \item (*) Circuit model that can capture $\EQ$ dag protocols but weaker that Circuit with local
        oracles.
    \item ((*) or (**)). What can we say about boolean dag complexity for $2$-fold Tseitin formulas?
