\textbf{The deadline is 23:59 on Wednesday 18 October.} Please submit your solutions on Moodle. Typing
your solutions using \LaTeX{} is strongly encouraged. The problems are meant to be worked on in groups of
2--3 students. Please submit only one writeup per team. You are strongly encouraged to solve these
problems by yourself. If you must, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems,
but you must credit all such sources in your writeup and you must never copy material verbatim.
