On this seminar we consider modern results in theoretical computer science. You will be asked to present
a paper with some state-of-the-art result or to present your own research projects. Participants who work in
theoretical computer science will be highly encouraged to present their areas. 

There is no specific program and dependencies on previous parts. You can take this seminar at any
semester. For example, you can take only ``Modern Methods-2'' or both ``Modern Methods-1'' and ``Modern
Methods-2''.
