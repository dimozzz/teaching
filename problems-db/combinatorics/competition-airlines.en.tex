A country called ``Competition'' has $2n$ cities. Every two of these cities have a direct flight (return
trip) between them. Prove that these flights can be distributed between n airlines so that, using each of
the airlines solely, one could get from any city to any other city (possibly with airplane changes but no
airline changes).
