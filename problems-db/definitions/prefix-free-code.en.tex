We say that a function $C\colon \{a_1, \dots, a_n\} \to \{0, 1\}^*$ is a \deftext{code} if it maps
letters of some alphabet to \deftext{code words}. If any string can be decoded (that is, cut onto images
of letters) in the only one unique way, we call such code \deftext{uniquely decodable}. The code is a
\deftext{prefix} code (or \deftext{prefix-free}), if any code word does not contain any other code word
as a prefix.
