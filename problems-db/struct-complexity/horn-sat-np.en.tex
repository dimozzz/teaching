We say that a \deftext{Horn} clause is a disjunction of literals that contains at most one literal
without negations sign. For example: $(x \lor \bar{y} \lor \bar{z} \lor \bar{w})$ is a Horn clause and
$(x \lor y)$ is not a Horn clause. Let $L$ be a language consists of satisfiable CNF formulas $\varphi$
such that every clause of $\varphi$ is either Horn or contains at most two literals. Show that $L$ is
$\NP$-complete.
