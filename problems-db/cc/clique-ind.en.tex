Show that $\DCC(\CIS_G) = \bigO{\log^2 n}$, where $x$ is interpreted as a characteristic function of a
clique in a graph $G$, and $y$ is interpreted as a characteristic function of an independent set in graph
$G$. $\CIS(x, y) = 1$, if clique and independent set have a common vertex. Both parties know graph $G$.
