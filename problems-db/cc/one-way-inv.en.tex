Alice has an $n$-bit string $x$, and Bob has an $n$-bit string $y$ such that $y$ differs from $x$ in
exactly single position.
\begin{enumcyr}
    \item Design a deterministic communication protocol with complexity $\bigO{\log n}$, which allows Bob
        to find out $x$.
    \item Design a one-round deterministic communication protocol with complexity $\bigO{\log n}$, which
        allows Bob to find out $x$. (In one-round protocol Alice sends some message to Bob, and after
        that Bob computes the result).
