Prove that there exist some functions $f\colon \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$, such that
$D(f) = \Omega(n)$, but the technique <<fooling set>> cannot prove that (i.e. there are no sets of points
$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_k, y_k)$ such that they have to lie in different monochromatic
rectangles and $k = 2^{\Omega(n)}$).
