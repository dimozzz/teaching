Consider graph $G$ with no loops. Alice and Bob get two vertices $x, y$ of a graph $G$ and want to find
out if there is an edge $(x, y)$. Show that the deterministic communication complexity of this problem
is at least $\log \chi(G)$, where $\chi(G)$ is a chromatic number of the graph $G$.

\hinttext{Hint:} try to construct a good colouring using an effective communication protocol.
