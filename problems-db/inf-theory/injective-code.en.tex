Let $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$ be an arbitrary alphabet, $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ be the probabilities of
letters of this alphabet. Show that for any injective code of its letters the average length of the code
is at least $h - 2 \log (h + 1) - 2$, where $h$ is an entropy of a distribution with probabilities $p_1,
p_2, \dots, p_n$.
