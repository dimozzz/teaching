You need to guess an integer number from $[n]$, while asking questions of the form <<Is it true that the
number is less than $t$?>> (for an arbitrary $t$). Show that:
\begin{enumlet}
    \item if you can once be lied to, then you can guess the number in $\log n + \bigO{\sqrt{\log n}}$
        questions; 
    \item if you can once be lied to, then you can guess the number in $\log n + \bigO{\log\log n}$
        questions;
\end{enumlet}
