Suppose there is a card; on one side of this card there is a number $n \geq 0$, on the other side there
is number $n + 1$. Alice and Bob sit opposite of each other and look at different sides of the card. A
conversation happens between them.
\begin{itemtask}
    \item[A:] I do not know Bob’s number.
    \item[B:] I do not know Alice’s number.
\end{itemtask}
This repeats 10 times, and then Alice tells that she knows Bob’s number. Which numbers could be written
on the card?
