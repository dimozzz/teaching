Suppose that for some distribution $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ it holds that:
$$
    I(\alpha : \beta \mid \gamma) = I(\alpha : \gamma \mid \beta) = I(\beta : \gamma \mid \alpha) = 0.
$$

Show that there exists a random variable $\eta$ such that $\entropy(\eta) = I(\alpha : \beta : \gamma)$
and $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are independent conditioned on $\eta$ (i.e.\ there is a ``realization'' of
information of triple $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$).
