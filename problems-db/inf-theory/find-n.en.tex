Your task is to guess a number from $1$ to $N$, and you are permitted to ask any questions with answer
``yes'' or ``no''. You can be lied to, but no more than once. How many questions do you need, if one
answer that is given to you might be incorrect in case:
\begin{enumlet}
    \item adaptive strategy can be used?
    \item all the questions must be written down in advance?
\end{enumlet}
