Show that $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are independent (the probability of the event ($\alpha = \alpha_i,
\beta = \beta_j, \gamma = \gamma_k$) equals to the product of three probabilities corresponding to each
variable) iff:
$$
    \entropy(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = \entropy(\alpha) + \entropy(\beta) + \entropy(\gamma).
$$
