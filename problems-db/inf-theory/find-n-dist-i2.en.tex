Alice picks a number $x \in \{1, \dots, n\}$ randomly in such a way that the probability of choosing $i$
is proportional to $1 / i^2$ (the coefficient is chosen such that the sum of all the probabilities equals
$1$).  Show that Bob can guess the number after asking Alice on average $\bigO{1}$ questions with answers
``yes/no''.
