Show that:
\begin{enumlet}
    \item Shannon--Fano code is prefix-free;
    \item if the central segment goes to the part where the most of this segment lies, then this code is
        not balanced (namely, there is no constant $d$ such that $\ell(c_i) < -\log{p_i} + d$ for any $k$
        and any probabilities $p_1, \dots, p_k$);
    \item if the central segment always goes to the right part, then Shannon--Fano code is not balanced
        as well. 
\end{enumlet}
